# MyReads Project

MyReads is a React project from the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). It teaches React fundamentals.

You can see a version of it online at [my-reads.wassim.io](http://my-reads.wassim.io).

It's all local, so just clone the repo and:

* Install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* Start the development server with `yarn start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
